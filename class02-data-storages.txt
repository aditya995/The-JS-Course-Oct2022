variables
constants

#
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, but TypeScript is a statically typed language. Longer answer: In dynamically typed languages all type checks are performed in a runtime, only when your program is executing. So this means you can just assign anything you want to the variable and it will work.

Difference between null and undefined
When checking for null or undefined, beware of the differences between equality (==) and identity (===) operators, as the former performs type-conversion.

typeof null          // "object" (not "null" for legacy reasons)
typeof undefined     // "undefined"
null === undefined   // false
null  == undefined   // true
null === null        // true
null == null         // true
!null                // true
isNaN(1 + null)      // false
isNaN(1 + undefined) // true
